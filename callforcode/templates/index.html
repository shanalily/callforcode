	    <p>We provide the tools to get volunteers where they're needed most, while employing the latest technologies to assess disaster damage and risk.</p>
	    <p>When diasaster strikes and help is desperately needed, one of the most signficant contributors to the chaos is misallocation and disorganization of volunteers
				and aid services. After seeing countless images on national news of disaster reilef volunteers being turned around due to miscommunications, hearing horror stories of people waiting for hours on their roofs during
				hurricanes for help to arrive, and even watching one of the creator's family get rescued from their flooded home via volunteer canoe since no emergency vehicles were availible at the time, the creators
				decided to develop (NAME HERE), in order to optimize the process. Employing machine learning, image recognition technologies, and network analysis, we are able to determine the most efficient
				ways to allocate volunteers, while determining levels of risk due to disaster damage in order to ensure that volunteers arrive with
				the aid equipment most useful for saving victims and to ensure volunteer and victim safety as well.
